# Load the data

# Calculate the t-statistic
t_statistic = (mean_group1 - mean_group2) / np.sqrt((std_group1**2 / len(group1)) + (std_group2**2 / len(group2)))

p_value = t.cdf(t_statistic, len(group1) + len(group2) - 2)

# If the p-value is less than the significance level, then we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the means of the two groups.

# Create the contingency table
contingency_table = pd.crosstab(df["group"], df["outcome"])

# Calculate the chi-squared statistic

# Calculate the p-value
p_value = chi2.cdf(chi_squared_statistic, len(contingency_table.columns) - 1)

# Print the results
print("chi-squared statistic:", chi_squared_statistic)

# If the p-value is less than the significance level, then we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the proportions of the two groups.

# These are just a few examples of how to conduct statistical tests in Python. There are many other statistical tests available, and the specific test that is used will depend on the research question being asked and the data that is available.
