A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain a population parameter. The confidence level is the probability that the interval contains the parameter. For example, a 95% confidence interval means that there is a 95% chance that the interval contains the parameter.

Confidence limits are the upper and lower bounds of a confidence interval. They are calculated using the sample statistic, the standard error of the statistic, and the confidence level.

To calculate a confidence interval, you need to know the following:

* The sample statistic: This is the value of the statistic that you are using to estimate the population parameter. For example, if you are estimating the mean height of a population, the sample statistic would be the mean height of your sample.
* The standard error of the statistic: This is a measure of how much variation there is in the statistic from sample to sample. It is calculated using the sample size and the standard deviation of the population.
* The confidence level: This is the probability that the interval contains the parameter. For example, a 95% confidence interval means that there is a 95% chance that the interval contains the parameter.

Once you have these three pieces of information, you can use the following formula to calculate the confidence interval:

```
Confidence interval = sample statistic ± (standard error of the statistic * z-score)
```

where z-score is the number of standard errors that you want to be confident that the interval contains the parameter. For a 95% confidence interval, z-score is 1.96.

For example, if the sample statistic is 50, the standard error of the statistic is 2, and the confidence level is 95%, then the confidence interval is:

```
Confidence interval = 50 ± (2 * 1.96) = 45.04 to 54.96
```

This means that we are 95% confident that the true mean height of the population is between 45.04 and 54.96 inches.

Confidence intervals can be used to make inferences about populations. For example, if we were to conduct a study to estimate the mean height of a population, we could use the confidence interval to determine whether the mean height is significantly different from a certain value. For example, if we found that the confidence interval for the mean height did not include 6 feet, then we could conclude that the mean height of the population is significantly less than 6 feet.

Confidence intervals are a powerful tool for making inferences about populations. They allow us to estimate the range of values that is likely to contain a population parameter, and they can be used to determine whether the mean of a population is significantly different from a certain value.
