Confidence intervals are used in a wide variety of real-world applications, including:

* **Polling:** Confidence intervals are often used in polling to estimate the level of support for a candidate or issue. For example, a poll may find that 52% of respondents support a candidate, with a 95% confidence interval of 48% to 56%. This means that we can be 95% confident that the true level of support for the candidate is between 48% and 56%.
* **Clinical trials:** Confidence intervals are often used in clinical trials to estimate the effectiveness of a new drug or treatment. For example, a clinical trial may find that a new drug reduces blood pressure by an average of 10 points, with a 95% confidence interval of 5 to 15 points. This means that we can be 95% confident that the true reduction in blood pressure is between 5 and 15 points.
* **Market research:** Confidence intervals are often used in market research to estimate the size of a market or the demand for a product. For example, a market research firm may find that the market for a new product is 1 million units, with a 95% confidence interval of 900,000 to 1.1 million units. This means that we can be 95% confident that the true size of the market is between 900,000 and 1.1 million units.
* **Quality control:** Confidence intervals are often used in quality control to estimate the variability of a product or process. For example, a quality control engineer may find that the weight of a product varies by an average of 0.5 grams, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.2 to 0.8 grams. This means that we can be 95% confident that the true variability of the product is between 0.2 and 0.8 grams.

Confidence intervals are a powerful tool that can be used to make inferences about populations based on samples. They are used in a wide variety of real-world applications, and can help us to make better decisions.
