Confidence intervals are a powerful tool that can be used to make inferences about populations based on samples. They are used in a wide variety of real-world applications, and can help us to make better decisions.

Here are some of the strong points of confidence intervals:

* **They are a way to quantify uncertainty.** Confidence intervals provide a range of values that are likely to contain the true population mean. This allows us to quantify our uncertainty about the true population mean.
* **They are relatively easy to calculate.** Confidence intervals can be calculated using simple formulas, even for large samples.
* **They are widely used.** Confidence intervals are used in a wide variety of real-world applications, including polling, clinical trials, market research, and quality control.

Overall, confidence intervals are a valuable tool that can be used to make inferences about populations based on samples. They are easy to calculate, widely used, and provide a way to quantify uncertainty.
