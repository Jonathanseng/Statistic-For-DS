The strong point of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is that it allows us to make inferences about a population based on a sample of that population. This is important because it is often not possible to collect data on an entire population, so we need to be able to make inferences based on a sample. The CLT tells us that as the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample means will approach a normal distribution. This means that we can use the normal distribution to make inferences about the population mean, even if the population distribution is not normal.

Here are some of the strong points of the CLT:

* It is a powerful tool that can be used to make inferences about populations.
* It is relatively easy to understand and apply.
* It is applicable to a wide variety of populations.
* It is robust to violations of its assumptions.

The CLT is a fundamental theorem in statistics and has many applications in a variety of fields, including:

* Economics
* Finance
* Medicine
* Education
* Psychology
* Sociology

The CLT is a powerful tool that can be used to make inferences about populations. It is relatively easy to understand and apply, and it is applicable to a wide variety of populations. The CLT is robust to violations of its assumptions, making it a valuable tool for statisticians.
