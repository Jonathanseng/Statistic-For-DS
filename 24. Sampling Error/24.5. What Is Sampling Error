Sampling error is the difference between the results of a sample survey and the results that would be obtained if the entire population were surveyed. It is caused by the fact that samples are not perfectly representative of the populations from which they are drawn.

There are a number of factors that can contribute to sampling error, including:

* The size of the sample. Larger samples are more likely to be representative of the population than smaller samples.
* The way in which the sample is selected. A sample that is selected randomly is more likely to be representative of the population than a sample that is selected non-randomly.
* The characteristics of the population. Some populations are more difficult to sample than others. For example, it is more difficult to sample a population that is spread out over a large area or that is difficult to contact.

Sampling error can be reduced by increasing the size of the sample and by selecting the sample randomly. However, it is impossible to eliminate sampling error completely.

Sampling error can be a serious problem for researchers. It can lead to inaccurate estimates of population parameters and to incorrect conclusions. Researchers must be aware of the potential for sampling error and take steps to minimize it.

Here are some examples of sampling error:

* A poll of 1,000 people finds that 55% support a new law. However, if the entire population were polled, it is possible that the true support for the law would be 52% or 58%.
* A study of 100 students finds that 60% of them have a GPA of 3.0 or higher. However, if the entire student body were studied, it is possible that the true percentage of students with a GPA of 3.0 or higher would be 58% or 62%.

Sampling error can be a challenge for researchers, but it can be minimized by taking steps to ensure that the sample is representative of the population.
