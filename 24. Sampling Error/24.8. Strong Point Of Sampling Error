The main strong point of sampling error is that it allows researchers to study populations that are too large to study in their entirety. This is because samples are a subset of the population, and they can be used to make inferences about the population as a whole.

For example, if a researcher wants to study the opinions of all adults in the United States, they could not survey every adult in the country. However, they could survey a sample of adults and use the results of the survey to make inferences about the opinions of all adults in the United States.

Sampling error can be a useful tool for researchers, but it is important to be aware of its limitations. As mentioned before, sampling error can lead to inaccurate results. Therefore, it is important for researchers to take steps to minimize sampling error, such as increasing the size of the sample and using a random sampling method.

Here are some additional strong points of sampling error:

* Sampling error is a relatively inexpensive way to study populations.
* Sampling error can be conducted quickly and easily.
* Sampling error can be used to study populations that are difficult to access.

Overall, sampling error is a valuable tool for researchers. By understanding the limitations of sampling error and taking steps to minimize it, researchers can use sampling error to make informed decisions about their research.
