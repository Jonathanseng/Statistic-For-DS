There is no single formula for an element in statistics. Elements can be anything that can be measured or counted, so the formula will vary depending on the type of data being collected.

However, there are some general formulas that can be used to calculate elements. For example, the formula for the mean of a set of data is:

```
Mean = (Sum of elements) / (Number of elements)
```

The formula for the median of a set of data is:

```
Median = (Element in the middle of the sorted set)
```

The formula for the mode of a set of data is:

```
Mode = (Element that occurs most frequently in the set)
```

These are just a few examples of formulas that can be used to calculate elements. The specific formula that is used will depend on the type of data being collected.
