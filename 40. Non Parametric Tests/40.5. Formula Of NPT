The formula for the Mann-Whitney U test is:

```
U = n₁(n₁ + 1)/2 - R₁
```

where:

* n₁ is the size of the first sample
* n₂ is the size of the second sample
* R₁ is the sum of the ranks for the first sample

The formula for the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is:

```
W = W₁ - W₂
```

where:

* W₁ is the sum of the positive ranks for the first sample
* W₂ is the sum of the negative ranks for the first sample

The formula for the Kruskal-Wallis test is:

```
H = 12∑R²/(n(n + 1))
```

where:

* R is the sum of the ranks for each group
* n is the number of groups

The formula for the Friedman test is:

```
χ² = 12∑R²/(n(n + 1)(2n + 1))
```

where:

* R is the sum of the ranks for each group
* n is the number of groups
