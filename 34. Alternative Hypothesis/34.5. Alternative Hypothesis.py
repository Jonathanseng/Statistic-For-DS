# Define the null hypothesis
H0 = np.mean(data) == 0

# Define the alternative hypothesis
H1 = np.mean(data) != 0

# Conduct the hypothesis test
p_value = stats.ttest_1samp(data, 0).pvalue

# Make a decision
if p_value < 0.05:
  print("Reject H0")
else:
  print("Fail to reject H0")

  # In this example, we are testing whether the mean of a sample is equal to 0. The null hypothesis is that the mean is equal to 0, and the alternative hypothesis is that the mean is not equal to 0. We conduct the hypothesis test using the ttest_1samp function from the scipy.stats library. The p_value returned by this function is the probability of obtaining a sample mean as extreme or more extreme than the one we observed, if the null hypothesis were true. If the p_value is less than 0.05, then we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the alternative hypothesis is true. Otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

#Here is an example of how to interpret the results of the hypothesis test:

#If we reject the null hypothesis, then we can conclude that there is a significant difference between the sample and the population. In this case, we can conclude that the mean of the sample is not equal to 0.
#If we fail to reject the null hypothesis, then we cannot conclude that there is a significant difference between the sample and the population. In this case, we cannot conclude that the mean of the sample is not equal to 0.
#It is important to note that hypothesis testing is a statistical procedure, and it is not a guarantee of truth. The results of a hypothesis test can only tell us whether there is enough evidence to support a particular claim.
