In statistics, an alternative hypothesis (Ha) is a statement that is contrary to the null hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis is what the researcher is trying to prove. It is often written in the form of a statement that there is a difference between two groups or that there is a relationship between two variables.

For example, a researcher might be interested in whether there is a difference in the average height of men and women. The null hypothesis would be that there is no difference in height between men and women. The alternative hypothesis would be that there is a difference in height between men and women.

The alternative hypothesis is typically tested using a statistical test. The results of the statistical test will provide evidence for or against the alternative hypothesis. If the results of the statistical test are statistically significant, then the researcher can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.

Here are some examples of alternative hypotheses:

* The average height of men is greater than the average height of women.
* There is a positive relationship between the amount of time a student studies and their GPA.
* There is a difference in the average weight of dogs that eat a raw food diet and dogs that eat a kibble diet.

The alternative hypothesis is an important part of statistical hypothesis testing. It is what the researcher is trying to prove and it is what the statistical test is designed to test.

The alternative hypothesis is denoted by H1. It is the opposite of the null hypothesis (H0), which states that there is no difference between the groups or sets of data. The alternative hypothesis can be either one-tailed or two-tailed.

**One-tailed alternative hypothesis**

The one-tailed alternative hypothesis states that there is a difference between the groups or sets of data, but it only specifies the direction of the difference. For example, the one-tailed alternative hypothesis could be:

* The average weight of a bag of chips is greater than 10 ounces.
* The average height of women in the United States is greater than the average height of men in the United States.
* The average score on a math test is higher for students who took a prep course than for students who did not take a prep course.

**Two-tailed alternative hypothesis**

The two-tailed alternative hypothesis states that there is a difference between the groups or sets of data, but it does not specify the direction of the difference. For example, the two-tailed alternative hypothesis could be:

* The average weight of a bag of chips is not equal to 10 ounces.
* The average height of women in the United States is not equal to the average height of men in the United States.
* The average score on a math test is not equal for students who took a prep course and for students who did not take a prep course.

The type of alternative hypothesis that is used depends on the research question and the data that is available.
