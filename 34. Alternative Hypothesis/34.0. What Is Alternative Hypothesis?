An alternative hypothesis is a statement that is contrary to the null hypothesis. It is the hypothesis that the researcher is trying to prove. The alternative hypothesis is usually written in the form of a statement that there is a difference between two groups or that there is a relationship between two variables.

For example, a researcher might be interested in whether there is a difference in the average height of men and women. The null hypothesis would be that there is no difference in the average height of men and women. The alternative hypothesis would be that there is a difference in the average height of men and women.

The alternative hypothesis is important because it is the hypothesis that the researcher is trying to prove. If the researcher can collect enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis, then they can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a difference between the two groups or that there is a relationship between the two variables.

Here are some examples of alternative hypotheses:

* There is a difference in the average height of men and women.
* People who take a certain medication are more likely to lose weight than people who do not take the medication.
* Students who attend a private school are more likely to get into a good college than students who attend a public school.

The alternative hypothesis is an important part of statistical hypothesis testing. It is the hypothesis that the researcher is trying to prove, and it is the hypothesis that is tested by the statistical analysis.
