The strong point of an alternative hypothesis is that it provides a clear and concise statement of what the researcher is trying to prove. This makes it easier to design a study that can test the hypothesis and to interpret the results of the study. Additionally, an alternative hypothesis that is well-defined can help to ensure that the study is conducted in a fair and unbiased manner.

Here are some of the strong points of an alternative hypothesis:

* It provides a clear and concise statement of what the researcher is trying to prove.
* It makes it easier to design a study that can test the hypothesis.
* It helps to ensure that the study is conducted in a fair and unbiased manner.
* It can help to lead to new discoveries and insights.

Here are some examples of alternative hypotheses:

* There is a difference in the average height of men and women.
* There is a relationship between the amount of sleep a person gets and their academic performance.
* Taking a certain medication will reduce the risk of developing a certain disease.

These are just a few examples of the many different types of alternative hypotheses that can be used in research. When an alternative hypothesis is well-defined, it can be a powerful tool for helping researchers to answer important questions and make new discoveries.
