Alternative hypothesis is a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. It is the hypothesis that we want to prove. In statistics, hypothesis testing is a process of making inferences about a population based on a sample. The alternative hypothesis is used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the sample and the population.

There are many real-life applications of alternative hypothesis. Here are a few examples:

* **Medicine:** Hypothesis testing is used to determine the effectiveness of new treatments or drugs. For example, a researcher might hypothesize that a new drug is more effective than the current standard of care for treating a particular disease. The researcher would then conduct a study to test this hypothesis. If the results of the study show that the new drug is more effective than the standard of care, then the researcher can conclude that the alternative hypothesis is true.
* **Marketing:** Hypothesis testing is used to determine the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or new product launches. For example, a marketing manager might hypothesize that a new advertising campaign will increase sales of a particular product. The manager would then conduct a study to test this hypothesis. If the results of the study show that the advertising campaign did increase sales, then the manager can conclude that the alternative hypothesis is true.
* **Quality control:** Hypothesis testing is used to determine whether a manufacturing process is producing products within acceptable quality limits. For example, a quality control manager might hypothesize that a new manufacturing process is producing products that meet the company's quality standards. The manager would then conduct a study to test this hypothesis. If the results of the study show that the new manufacturing process is producing products that meet the company's quality standards, then the manager can conclude that the alternative hypothesis is true.

These are just a few examples of the many real-life applications of alternative hypothesis. Hypothesis testing is a powerful tool that can be used to make inferences about a population based on a sample.
