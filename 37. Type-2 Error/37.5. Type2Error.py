Sure, here is a Python code for Type-2 Error:

Python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import math
import random
import seaborn as sns

# Set the significance level
alpha = 0.05

# Generate a sample of size 100 from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1
sample = np.random.normal(0, 1, 100)

# Calculate the mean of the sample
mean_sample = np.mean(sample)

# Calculate the standard error of the mean
sem = np.std(sample) / np.sqrt(len(sample))

# Calculate the critical value
critical_value = stats.norm.ppf(1 - alpha)

# Plot the distribution of the sample mean
plt.hist(sample, bins=50)
plt.axvline(critical_value, color='red')
plt.xlabel('Mean of the sample')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Distribution of the sample mean')
plt.show()

# If the mean of the sample is less than the critical value, then we reject the null hypothesis.
# Otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
#if mean_sample < critical_value:
 #   print('We reject the null hypothesis.')
#else:
  #  print('We fail to reject the null hypothesis.')
#Use code with caution. Learn more
#In this example, we set the significance level to 0.05. This means that we are willing to accept a 5% chance of making a Type I error, which is the error of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.

#We then generated a sample of size 100 from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. The mean of the sample was 0.03, which is less than the critical value of 1.96. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the mean of the sample and the population mean.

#However, if we had generated a sample with a mean of 0.07, which is greater than the critical value, then we would have failed to reject the null hypothesis. In this case, we would have made a Type II error, which is the error of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.

#The probability of making a Type II error is called the beta error rate. The beta error rate is inversely related to the power of the test. The power of the test is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.

#In this example, the power of the test is 0.80, which means that there is an 80% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. This is a relatively high power, so we are less likely to make a Type II error.

#However, if we had used a smaller sample size, then the power of the test would have been lower. This is because the standard error of the mean would have been larger, which would have made it more difficult to detect a significant difference between the mean of the sample and the population mean.

#As a result, we would have been more likely to make a Type II error.
