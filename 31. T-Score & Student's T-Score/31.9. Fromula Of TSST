The formula for a T-score is:

```
t = (x - μ) / s / √n
```

where:

* t is the T-score
* x is the individual score
* μ is the population mean
* s is the population standard deviation
* n is the sample size

The formula for Student's t-score is the same, except that the population mean and standard deviation are replaced with the sample mean and standard deviation:

```
t = (x - x̄) / s / √n
```

where:

* t is the Student's t-score
* x is the individual score
* x̄ is the sample mean
* s is the sample standard deviation
* n is the sample size

T-scores and Student's t-scores are both measures of how far away an individual score is from the mean in terms of standard deviations. T-scores are typically used when the population mean and standard deviation are unknown, while Student's t-scores are used when the population mean and standard deviation are known.
