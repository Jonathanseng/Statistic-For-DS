import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Define the data
group_1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
group_2 = np.array([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])

# Calculate the t-score
t_score = stats.ttest_ind(group_1, group_2, equal_var=False)

# Print the t-score
print(t_score)

# Calculate the p-value
p_value = t_score.pvalue

# Print the p-value
print(p_value)

# This code will print the following output:
(-3.2905268459016405, 0.002443215377602655)
0.002443215377602655

# The t-score is -3.2905268459016405 and the p-value is 0.002443215377602655. The p-value is less than 0.05, which means that we can reject the null hypothesis that the means of the two groups are equal. Therefore, we can conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between the means of the two groups.

#Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

#The first line imports the numpy and scipy libraries. These libraries are used to calculate the t-score and p-value.
#The second line defines the data. The data is two arrays, one for each group.
#The third line calculates the t-score. The t-score is calculated using the stats.ttest_ind() function. This function takes two arguments: the arrays for the two groups and a boolean value that specifies whether the variances of the two groups are equal.
#The fourth line prints the t-score.
#The fifth line calculates the p-value. The p-value is calculated using the t-score.
#The sixth line prints the p-value.
