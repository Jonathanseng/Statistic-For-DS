T-scores and Student's t-scores are both statistical measures that are used to compare the results of two different groups. However, there are some limitations to their use.

One limitation of T-scores is that they are only accurate for small sample sizes. When the sample size is large, the t-distribution becomes more normal and the T-score is more accurate.

Another limitation of T-scores is that they are not always sensitive to differences in the means of the two groups. If the means of the two groups are very close together, the T-score may not be able to detect a significant difference.

Finally, T-scores are not always reliable. If the data is not normally distributed, the T-score may not be accurate.

Student's t-test is also limited by the assumption that the data is normally distributed. If the data is not normally distributed, the results of the t-test may be inaccurate.

Despite these limitations, T-scores and Student's t-scores can be useful tools for comparing the results of two different groups. When used correctly, they can provide valuable information about the differences between the two groups.

Here are some additional limitations of T-scores and Student's t-tests:

* They are not always sensitive to differences in the variances of the two groups.
* They can be affected by outliers, or extreme values.
* They can be affected by the choice of the significance level.

It is important to be aware of these limitations when using T-scores and Student's t-tests. By understanding the limitations, you can make more informed decisions about when to use these statistical tools.
