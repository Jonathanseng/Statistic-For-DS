import statistics

# Define the data set
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Calculate the mean
mean = statistics.mean(data)

# Calculate the variance
variance = statistics.variance(data)

# Calculate the standard deviation
standard_deviation = statistics.stdev(data)

# Print the results
print("Mean:", mean)
print("Variance:", variance)
print("Standard deviation:", standard_deviation)

# his code will print the following output:
Mean: 3
Variance: 2.5
Standard deviation: 1.5811388300841898
