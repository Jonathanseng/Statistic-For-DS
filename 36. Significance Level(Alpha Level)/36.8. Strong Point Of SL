The strong point of significance level (alpha level) is that it provides a clear and objective way to determine whether the results of a statistical test are significant or not. By setting a specific alpha level, researchers can control the risk of making a Type I error, which is rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. This helps to ensure that the results of a statistical test are reliable and can be trusted.

Here are some of the specific benefits of using a significance level:

* It provides a clear and objective way to determine whether the results of a statistical test are significant or not.
* It helps to control the risk of making a Type I error.
* It can be used to compare the results of different statistical tests.
* It can be used to make decisions about whether to reject the null hypothesis or not.

However, it is important to note that there are also some limitations to using a significance level. One limitation is that it can be difficult to determine the appropriate alpha level to use in a particular situation. Another limitation is that it does not take into account the size of the effect being studied.

Overall, the significance level is a valuable tool that can be used to help researchers make informed decisions about the results of their statistical tests. However, it is important to be aware of the limitations of the significance level and to use it in conjunction with other statistical tools to get the most accurate results.
