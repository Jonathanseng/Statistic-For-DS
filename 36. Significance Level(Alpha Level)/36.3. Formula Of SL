The formula for significance level (alpha level) is:

```
α = 1 - confidence level
```

where:

* α is the significance level
* confidence level is the probability that the null hypothesis is true

For example, if the confidence level is 95%, then the significance level is 5%. This means that there is a 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.

The significance level is typically set before the data is collected. It is used to determine whether the results of a statistical test are statistically significant. A statistically significant result means that the results are unlikely to have occurred by chance. A non-statistically significant result means that the results could have occurred by chance.

The significance level is an important concept in statistical hypothesis testing. By understanding the significance level, researchers can help to reduce the risk of making a Type I error and ensure that their results are reliable.
