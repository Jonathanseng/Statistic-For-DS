Significance level (also known as alpha level) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. It is typically set at 0.05, which means that there is a 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.

The significance level is used in hypothesis testing to determine whether the results of a statistical test are statistically significant. A statistically significant result means that the results are unlikely to have occurred by chance. A non-statistically significant result means that the results could have occurred by chance.

The significance level is important because it helps researchers to control the risk of making a Type I error. A Type I error occurs when a researcher rejects the null hypothesis when it is actually true. This can lead to false positive results, which can have serious consequences.

For example, a researcher might conduct a study to test the effectiveness of a new drug. If the researcher rejects the null hypothesis and concludes that the drug is effective, but the drug is actually not effective, this could lead to people taking a drug that is not helpful and could even be harmful.

By setting a significance level, researchers can help to reduce the risk of making a Type I error. However, it is important to note that no significance level can completely eliminate the risk of a Type I error.

Here is how significance level works in hypothesis testing:

1. The researcher sets a significance level, typically 0.05.
2. The researcher collects data and conducts a statistical test.
3. The researcher calculates the p-value, which is the probability of getting the observed results or more extreme results if the null hypothesis is true.
4. If the p-value is less than or equal to the significance level, the researcher rejects the null hypothesis and concludes that the results are statistically significant.
5. If the p-value is greater than the significance level, the researcher fails to reject the null hypothesis and concludes that the results are not statistically significant.

It is important to note that a statistically significant result does not necessarily mean that the results are important or meaningful. It simply means that the results are unlikely to have occurred by chance. The researcher must also consider the size of the effect and the practical significance of the results before drawing any conclusions.
