import numpy as np

# Define the data
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Calculate the mean
mean = np.mean(data)

# Calculate the variance
variance = np.var(data)

# Calculate the standard deviation
standard_deviation = np.std(data)

# Print the results
print("Mean:", mean)
print("Variance:", variance)
print("Standard deviation:", standard_deviation)

# This code will print the following output:
Mean: 3
Variance: 2
Standard deviation: 1.4142135623730951

 # Here is a brief explanation of each measure of dispersion:

#Mean: The mean is the average of the data points. It is calculated by adding all of the data points and then dividing by the number of data points.
#Variance: The variance is a measure of how spread out the data points are from the mean. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between the data points and the mean.
#Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is a measure of how far, on average, the data points are from the mean.
#These measures of dispersion can be used to compare different data sets or to track how a data set changes over time.
