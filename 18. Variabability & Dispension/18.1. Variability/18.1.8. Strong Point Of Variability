The strong point of variability is that it can be used to understand and analyze data. By understanding the variability of a set of data, we can better understand the patterns in the data and the relationships between different variables. This information can be used to make decisions, to develop theories, and to create models.

Here are some of the strong points of variability:

* **It can be used to understand and analyze data.** By understanding the variability of a set of data, we can better understand the patterns in the data and the relationships between different variables. This information can be used to make decisions, to develop theories, and to create models.
* **It can be used to identify outliers.** Outliers are data points that are very different from the rest of the data. Outliers can be identified by looking at the variability of the data.
* **It can be used to measure uncertainty.** Variability can be used to measure uncertainty. The higher the variability, the more uncertainty there is in the data.
* **It can be used to compare different sets of data.** Variability can be used to compare different sets of data. This can be helpful in understanding how different sets of data are related.

Despite these strong points, variability is not a perfect measure of uncertainty. It is important to understand the limitations of variability before using it to make decisions.
