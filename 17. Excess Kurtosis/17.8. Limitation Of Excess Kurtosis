Excess kurtosis is a measure of the peakedness of a distribution. It is calculated as the fourth standardized moment of a distribution, minus 3. A distribution with a high excess kurtosis is said to be leptokurtic, meaning that it has a peak that is more pronounced than a normal distribution. A distribution with a low excess kurtosis is said to be platykurtic, meaning that it has a peak that is less pronounced than a normal distribution.

Here are some of the limitations of excess kurtosis:

* **It is sensitive to outliers.** This means that a small number of extreme values can have a large impact on the calculated kurtosis. As a result, excess kurtosis should not be used as the sole measure of the peakedness of a distribution.
* **It is not always easy to interpret.** This is because the interpretation of kurtosis depends on the shape of the distribution. For example, a distribution with a high excess kurtosis could be leptokurtic or platykurtic, depending on whether the tails of the distribution are heavy or light.
* **It is not always a good measure of risk.** This is because kurtosis does not take into account the variability of a distribution. As a result, a distribution with a high kurtosis could be risky even if it has a low variance.

Despite these limitations, excess kurtosis can be a useful tool for measuring the peakedness of a distribution. However, it is important to be aware of the limitations of kurtosis and to use it in conjunction with other measures of distributional shape.

Here are some suggestions for how to overcome the limitations of excess kurtosis:

* Use other measures of distributional shape, such as skewness and the median absolute deviation.
* Use robust methods for calculating kurtosis, such as Winsorized kurtosis.
* Use kurtosis in conjunction with other statistical methods, such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.
