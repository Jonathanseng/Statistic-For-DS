Standard scores have several strong points. They are:

* **Easy to interpret:** Standard scores are easier to interpret than raw scores. For example, a standard score of 0 means that the score is equal to the mean, while a standard score of 1 means that the score is one standard deviation above the mean.
* **Comparable:** Standard scores are comparable across different tests or scales. This means that you can compare a student's score on the SAT to their score on the ACT, even though the two tests have different means and standard deviations.
* **Consistent:** Standard scores are consistent across time. This means that if you take the same test twice, your standard score will be the same, even if your raw score is different.
* **Reliable:** Standard scores are reliable. This means that they are not affected by random fluctuations in the data.

Overall, standard scores are a valuable tool for comparing scores from different tests or scales, or for comparing scores within the same test or scale. They are easy to interpret, comparable, consistent, and reliable.
