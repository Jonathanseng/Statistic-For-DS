In statistics, a standard score is the number of standard deviations by which the value of a raw score (i.e., an observed value or data point) is above or below the mean value of what is being observed or measured. Raw scores above the mean have positive standard scores, while those below the mean have negative standard scores.

It is calculated by subtracting the population mean from an individual raw score and then dividing the difference by the population standard deviation. This process of converting a raw score into a standard score is called standardizing or normalizing (however, "normalizing" can refer to many types of ratios; see normalization for more). Standard scores are most commonly called z-scores; the two terms may be used interchangeably, as they are in this article. Other equivalent terms in use include z-values, normal scores, standardized variables and pull in high energy physics.

Standard scores are used to compare scores from different tests or scales that have different means and standard deviations. For example, the SAT and ACT are both standardized tests that are used to assess college readiness. The SAT has a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100, while the ACT has a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of 5. This means that a score of 600 on the SAT is equivalent to a score of 30 on the ACT.

Standard scores are also used to compare scores within the same test or scale. For example, the GRE is a standardized test that is used to assess graduate school readiness. The GRE has a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. This means that a score of 600 on the GRE is one standard deviation above the mean, while a score of 400 is one standard deviation below the mean.

Standard scores can be used to make decisions about individuals or groups. For example, a school might use standard scores to decide which students are eligible for the gifted and talented program. A company might use standard scores to decide which employees are eligible for promotion.

Standard scores are a useful tool for comparing scores from different tests or scales, or for comparing scores within the same test or scale. They can be used to make decisions about individuals or groups.
