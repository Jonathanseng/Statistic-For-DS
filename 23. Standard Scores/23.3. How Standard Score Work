Standard scores, also known as z-scores, are a way of expressing a raw score in terms of how many standard deviations it is above or below the mean. They are calculated by subtracting the mean from the raw score and then dividing the difference by the standard deviation.

For example, let's say that the mean score on a test is 75 and the standard deviation is 10. If a student scores 85 on the test, their standard score would be 1.0. This means that their score is one standard deviation above the mean.

Standard scores are useful for comparing scores from different tests or scales that have different means and standard deviations. For example, the SAT and ACT are both standardized tests that are used to assess college readiness. The SAT has a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100, while the ACT has a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of 5. This means that a score of 600 on the SAT is equivalent to a score of 30 on the ACT.

Standard scores can also be used to compare scores within the same test or scale. For example, the GRE is a standardized test that is used to assess graduate school readiness. The GRE has a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. This means that a score of 600 on the GRE is one standard deviation above the mean, while a score of 400 is one standard deviation below the mean.

Standard scores are a useful tool for comparing scores from different tests or scales, or for comparing scores within the same test or scale. They can be used to make decisions about individuals or groups.

Here are some of the benefits of using standard scores:

* They allow you to compare scores from different tests or scales that have different means and standard deviations.
* They can be used to make decisions about individuals or groups.
* They can be used to identify students who are struggling or excelling.
* They can be used to track student progress over time.

Here are some of the limitations of using standard scores:

* They can be difficult to understand for some people.
* They can be used to make decisions about individuals or groups that may not be accurate.
* They can be used to compare scores that are not directly comparable.

Overall, standard scores are a useful tool for comparing scores from different tests or scales, or for comparing scores within the same test or scale. They can be used to make decisions about individuals or groups, but it is important to be aware of their limitations.
