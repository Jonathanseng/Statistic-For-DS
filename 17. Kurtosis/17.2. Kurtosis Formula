The kurtosis formula is:

```
kurtosis = (μ^4 / σ^4) - 3
```

where:

* μ is the mean of the distribution
* σ is the standard deviation of the distribution

Kurtosis is a measure of the "peakedness" of a distribution. A distribution with high kurtosis is said to be leptokurtic, while a distribution with low kurtosis is said to be platykurtic. A distribution with kurtosis equal to 3 is said to be mesokurtic.

The normal distribution is mesokurtic, with a kurtosis of 3. The Poisson distribution is leptokurtic, with a kurtosis greater than 3. The exponential distribution is platykurtic, with a kurtosis less than 3.

Kurtosis can be used to identify outliers in a data set. Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data. Leptokurtic distributions are more likely to have outliers than platykurtic distributions.

For example, let's say we have a data set of heights of people. The mean height is 6 feet, and the standard deviation is 2 inches. If we plot this data on a histogram, we would expect to see a bell-shaped curve. However, if there is an outlier in the data set, such as someone who is 7 feet tall, the histogram will no longer be a bell shape. Instead, it will have a longer tail on the right side.

Kurtosis can also be used to compare different data sets. For example, let's say we have two data sets of test scores. The first data set has a kurtosis of 2, while the second data set has a kurtosis of 4. This means that the second data set has a higher peak and fatter tails than the first data set. In other words, the second data set is more likely to have outliers than the first data set.

Kurtosis is a useful tool for understanding the shape of a distribution. It can be used to identify outliers and to compare different data sets.
