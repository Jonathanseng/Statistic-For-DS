The strong point of kurtosis is that it can be used to measure the shape of a distribution. Kurtosis is a measure of how much the data points in a distribution are concentrated around the mean. A distribution with high kurtosis is said to be "peaked" or "heavy-tailed", meaning that the data points are more concentrated around the mean and there are more extreme values in the distribution. A distribution with low kurtosis is said to be "flat" or "light-tailed", meaning that the data points are more spread out around the mean and there are fewer extreme values in the distribution.

Kurtosis can be used to compare different distributions and to identify outliers. For example, a distribution with high kurtosis is more likely to have outliers than a distribution with low kurtosis. Kurtosis can also be used to identify distributions that are not normally distributed.

The main strong point of kurtosis is that it is a relatively simple measure to calculate. It can be calculated using a formula that only requires the mean and standard deviation of the distribution. This makes kurtosis a useful tool for data analysts who need to quickly assess the shape of a distribution.

Here are some of the strong points of kurtosis:

* Kurtosis can be used to measure the shape of a distribution.
* Kurtosis can be used to compare different distributions.
* Kurtosis can be used to identify outliers.
* Kurtosis can be used to identify distributions that are not normally distributed.

However, there are also some limitations to kurtosis. One limitation is that kurtosis is sensitive to outliers. This means that a small number of extreme values can have a significant impact on the kurtosis of a distribution. Another limitation is that kurtosis is not always a reliable measure of the shape of a distribution. This is because kurtosis can be affected by the scale of the data. For example, a distribution with high kurtosis may have a low kurtosis if the data is scaled.

Overall, kurtosis is a useful tool for data analysts, but it is important to be aware of its limitations.
