Variance is a measure of how spread out a set of data is. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. A higher variance indicates that the data is more spread out, while a lower variance indicates that the data is more tightly clustered around the mean.

The formula for variance is:

```
variance = (sum of (x - mean)^2) / n
```

where:

* x is a data point
* mean is the average of the data points
* n is the number of data points

For example, let's say we have the following data set:

```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

The mean of this data set is 3. The squared differences between each data point and the mean are:

```
(1 - 3)^2 = 4
(2 - 3)^2 = 1
(3 - 3)^2 = 0
(4 - 3)^2 = 1
(5 - 3)^2 = 4
```

The sum of these squared differences is 10. The variance of this data set is therefore:

```
variance = (10 / 5) = 2
```

This tells us that the data in this set is spread out over a range of 2 units.

Variance can be used to compare the spread of different data sets. For example, if we have two data sets with the same mean, the data set with the higher variance will be more spread out.

Variance can also be used to calculate the standard deviation, which is a more commonly used measure of spread. The standard deviation is calculated by taking the square root of the variance.

Variance is a useful tool for understanding the spread of data. It can be used to compare different data sets, to identify outliers, and to make predictions about future data.
