A null hypothesis is a statement that there is no difference between two sets of data or variables being analyzed. It is often denoted as H0. The alternative hypothesis is the opposite of the null hypothesis, and it states that there is a difference between the two sets of data or variables.

In simple words, the null hypothesis is the statement that you are trying to disprove. For example, if you are trying to prove that a new drug is effective, your null hypothesis would be that the drug is not effective.

To test the null hypothesis, you would collect data and use statistical tests to determine if the data is consistent with the null hypothesis. If the data is not consistent with the null hypothesis, then you can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a difference between the two sets of data or variables.

Here is an example of a null hypothesis:

* There is no difference in the average height of men and women.

This hypothesis states that there is no difference in the average height of men and women. If you collect data and find that the average height of men is significantly different from the average height of women, then you can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a difference in the average height of men and women.
