  # In this example, the null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the average height of men and women. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in the average height of men and women. The data is collected from two groups, men and women, and the p-value is calculated. The p-value is the probability of obtaining the observed results if the null hypothesis is true. If the p-value is less than 0.05, then the null hypothesis is rejected. If the p-value is greater than 0.05, then the null hypothesis is not rejected.

#In this example, the p-value is 0.01, which is less than 0.05. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a difference in the average height of men and women.
