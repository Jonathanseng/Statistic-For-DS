P-values are used in a variety of real-world applications, including:

* **Medical research:** P-values are used to determine the effectiveness of new drugs and treatments. For example, a study might compare the results of a new drug to a placebo to see if the new drug is more effective at treating a particular disease. If the p-value is less than 0.05, then the new drug is considered to be statistically significant and is likely to be effective in treating the disease.
* **Business research:** P-values are used to make decisions about marketing campaigns, product development, and other business initiatives. For example, a company might conduct a survey to see if there is a correlation between people's age and their likelihood to buy a particular product. If the p-value is less than 0.05, then the company can conclude that there is a statistically significant relationship between age and product purchase. This information can be used to target marketing campaigns and product development efforts.
* **Social science research:** P-values are used to test hypotheses about social phenomena. For example, a sociologist might hypothesize that people who live in poverty are more likely to commit crimes. The sociologist could conduct a study to test this hypothesis by comparing the crime rates of people who live in poverty to the crime rates of people who do not live in poverty. If the p-value is less than 0.05, then the sociologist can conclude that there is a statistically significant relationship between poverty and crime.

P-values are a valuable tool for statistical analysis, but it is important to remember that they are not the only factor to consider when interpreting the results of a study. Other factors, such as the effect size and the clinical significance of the results, should also be considered.
