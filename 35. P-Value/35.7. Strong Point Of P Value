P-values are a measure of the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme as the one observed, given that the null hypothesis is true. A low p-value (typically <0.05) is often interpreted as evidence against the null hypothesis and in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

P-values have a number of strengths, including:

* They are a simple and intuitive way to measure the statistical significance of a result.
* They are widely used in scientific research, which makes it easy to compare results from different studies.
* They can be used to make decisions about whether to reject the null hypothesis and in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

Here are some additional examples of the strong points of p-values:

* P-values can be used to quantify the evidence against the null hypothesis. A lower p-value indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.
* P-values can be used to make decisions about whether to reject the null hypothesis. A p-value of less than 0.05 is typically considered to be statistically significant, which means that there is less than a 5% chance that the results could have occurred by chance.
* P-values can be used to compare the results of different studies. A study with a lower p-value is generally considered to provide stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.

Overall, p-values are a useful tool for statistical analysis. They are simple to understand, widely used, and can be used to make decisions about the significance of a result. However, p-values should be interpreted with caution, as they have a number of weaknesses.
