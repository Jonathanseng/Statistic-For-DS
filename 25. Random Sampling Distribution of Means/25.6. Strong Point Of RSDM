The random sampling distribution of means is a powerful tool that can be used to make inferences about populations based on samples. It has several strong points, including:

* **It is based on the central limit theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of means will be approximately normally distributed as the sample size increases.** This means that we can use the normal distribution to make inferences about the population mean, even if the population itself is not normally distributed.
* **It is relatively easy to calculate.** The sampling distribution of means can be calculated using a simple formula.
* **It is a versatile tool.** The sampling distribution of means can be used to make a variety of inferences about populations, including testing for a difference in means, estimating a population mean, and making predictions about future samples.

Overall, the random sampling distribution of means is a powerful and versatile tool that can be used to make inferences about populations based on samples. It is based on a sound theoretical foundation, it is relatively easy to calculate, and it can be used to make a variety of inferences.
