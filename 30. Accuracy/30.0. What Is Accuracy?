In statistics, accuracy is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to that quantity's true value. In other words, accuracy is how close a measurement is to the actual value.

Accuracy is determined by the difference between the measured value and the actual value. The smaller the difference, the more accurate the measurement.

There are a number of factors that can affect the accuracy of a measurement, including the following:

* The precision of the measuring instrument.
* The skill of the person taking the measurement.
* The conditions under which the measurement is taken.

Accuracy is important in statistics because it allows us to make accurate inferences about the population from which the sample was drawn. For example, if we want to know the average height of all adults in the United States, we can take a sample of adults and measure their height. If our measurements are accurate, we can be confident that the average height of the sample is close to the average height of the population.

There are a number of ways to improve the accuracy of measurements, including the following:

* Using more precise measuring instruments.
* Training people to take measurements accurately.
* Taking measurements under controlled conditions.

By taking steps to improve the accuracy of our measurements, we can improve the accuracy of our inferences about the population.
