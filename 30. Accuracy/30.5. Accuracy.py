# This code will print the accuracy of the logistic regression model on the test set. The accuracy is a measure of how well the model predicts the target variable. A higher accuracy indicates that the model is better at making predictions.

#Here is an explanation of the code:

#The import statements import the necessary libraries.
#The read_csv function reads the data from the CSV file.
#The train_test_split function splits the data into training and test sets.
#The LogisticRegression class is used to create a logistic regression model.
#The fit method is used to train the model on the training set.
#The predict method is used to make predictions on the test set.
#The accuracy_score function is used to calculate the accuracy.
#The print statement prints the accuracy.
