data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

variance, standard_deviation = bessels_correction(data)

print(variance)
# 2.25

print(standard_deviation)
# 1.5

# As you can see, the sample variance and standard deviation with Bessel's correction are slightly different from the sample variance and standard deviation without Bessel's correction. This is because Bessel's correction corrects for the bias in the estimation of the population variance and standard deviation.
