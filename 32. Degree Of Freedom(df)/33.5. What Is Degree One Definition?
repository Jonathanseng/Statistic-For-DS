The term "degree one" has multiple meanings, depending on the context. 

In mathematics, degree one can refer to:

* The degree of a polynomial, which is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. For example, the polynomial $x^2 + 2x + 1$ has degree two.
* The degree of an equation, which is the highest power of the variable in the equation. For example, the equation $x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0$ has degree two.
* The degree of a curve, which is a measure of how curved the curve is. For example, a circle has degree one.

In computer science, degree one can refer to:

* The degree of a vertex in a graph, which is the number of edges connected to the vertex.
* The degree of a polynomial, which is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial.
* The degree of a function, which is the highest power of the variable in the function.

In geometry, degree one can refer to:

* The degree of an angle, which is the measure of the angle in degrees.
* The degree of a curve, which is a measure of how curved the curve is. For example, a circle has degree one.
* The degree of a surface, which is a measure of how curved the surface is. For example, a sphere has degree two.

In other contexts, degree one can refer to:

* The first level of a hierarchy or ranking system.
* The first level of difficulty in a game or test.
* The first level of a certification program.
