# Define the true and predicted labels
y_true = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1, 1])

# Print the precision score
print(precision)

# This code will print the following output:
0.8

# This means that the precision score for this model is 0.8, which is a good score. A precision score of 1 would mean that the model perfectly classifies all of the positive samples, while a precision score of 0 would mean that the model perfectly classifies none of the positive samples.

#Here is a breakdown of the terms used in the precision score formula:

#True positives (TP): These are the samples that were correctly classified as positive.
#False positives (FP): These are the samples that were incorrectly classified as positive.
#True negatives (TN): These are the samples that were correctly classified as negative.
#False negatives (FN): These are the samples that were incorrectly classified as negative.
#The precision score is calculated as follows:

precision = TP / (TP + FP)

# This means that the precision score is the ratio of the true positives to the total number of positive predictions (true positives + false positives).

#Precision is a measure of how accurate a model is at classifying positive samples. A high precision score means that the model is good at identifying positive samples, while a low precision score means that the model is not very good at identifying positive samples.

#Precision is often used in conjunction with recall, which is another measure of a model's accuracy. Recall is the percentage of positive samples that are correctly classified. A high recall score means that the model is good at identifying all of the positive samples, while a low recall score means that the model misses some of the positive samples.

#The F1 score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall. This means that the F1 score takes into account both precision and recall, and it gives a more balanced measure of a model's accuracy. A high F1 score means that the model is good at both identifying positive samples and not missing any positive samples.
